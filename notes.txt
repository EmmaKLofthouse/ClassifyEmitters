- CNN
- run on images of spec first then add in images from cubex (halves, mean, median)
- create image with colour gradient showing error. See Ignasi's work and look into Squeeze



- trim spectrum to region of interest based on expected redshift?


use time series on spectra then CNN on images?


Or GCN - Graph convolutional network
